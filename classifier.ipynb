Contract Renewal Term  = Optional Renewal Conditions for Renewal = CW may renew for three additional 1 year terms in its sole discretion (a) Prior to the termination or expiration and non-renewal of the Term of the Agreement, C&W has the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the Service Term of any then-current Service Addendum under this Agreement for an additional period of one (1) year, with C&W having the right to repeat such extension up to three times up to a total extension of the Term of no more than three years. (b)  Each extension of the term of any Service Addendum in accordance with subsection (a), shall be on the same terms and conditions of the Agreement (including pricing) as exist at the point in time when the extension takes effect. Right to Terminate  = At Will (CW Only) (c) C&W has the right, in its sole and absolute discretion and without payment of any penalty, to terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time during the term hereof upon thirty (30) days prior written Termination Notice = 30 days notice to Contractor. Any termination of this Agreement under this provision shall not affect the Parties\\' rights and obligations thereunder that accrued prior to the date of termination, which shall survive such termination. (d)  If Contractor shall default in the performance of any of its obligations under the Agreement (including without limitation violation of any law), then, C&W has the right, without payment of any penalty, to terminate this Master Agreement, in whole or in part, immediately upon written notice to Contractor. Furthermore, the Agreement and C&W\\’s obligation to pay any compensation to Contractor hereunder shall terminate immediately with respect to all transactions if the continuation of the Agreement would violate Applicable Anti-Corruption Laws (as such term is defined in Section 33(b) below). (e)  If a receiver, liquidator or trustee for Contractor shall be appointed by court order; or a petition shall be filed against Contractor under any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency law; or Contractor shall file a petition in voluntary bankruptcy or shall request reorganization under any provision of voluntary bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency laws; or if Contractor shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, then the entire Agreement shall immediately terminate upon the happening of any such event. (f)  For clarity, any right of C&W to terminate the Agreement also allows C&W to terminate a Service Addendum, in whole or in part, without having to terminate the Agreement or any other Service Addendum. Termination of a Service Addendum shall not affect any other Service Addendum. Indemnity = Vendor Indemnity when this provision contains \\\"C&W Indemnitees\\\" only) 21. INDEMNIFICATION.

(b)  In addition, Contractor shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend, at its sole cost and expense, the C&W Indemnitees from any loss, damage, expense (including attorneys’ fees and costs), payment, recovery and judgment arising out of any claim or threatened claim, alleging that any Services furnished hereunder infringe upon or violate a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right of any third party. C&W, at its sole cost and expense, shall have the right to be represented in any such action or proceeding by independent counsel of C&W's own choice. Contractor's liability under this subsection (b) shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement, but this shall not be construed to mean that Contractor's liability does not survive as to other provisions of the Agreement. (c) Contractor shall, at its own expense, defend any and all actions brought against C&W based upon any of the foregoing and shall pay all attorneys’ fees and all other expenses, and promptly discharge any judgments, settlements or compromises arising therefrom. No third party claim or action may be settled or compromised by Contractor without C&W’s prior written consent, unless the settlement or compromise includes a release of all claims against C&W and Client as applicable by the party bringing the claim or action; and C&W will have the right at its sole expense to participate in the legal proceeding with counsel of its own choosing. C&W will assist and cooperate in the defense as reasonably requested by Contractor, at Contractor’s expense. (d) Contractor's liability under this Section 21 (Indemnification) shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement, but this shall not be construed to mean that Contractor's liability does not survive as to other provisions of the Agreement.\""
