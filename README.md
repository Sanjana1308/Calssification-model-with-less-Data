# Calssification-model-with-less-Data
As per my dataset which was less , I have 5 different classes with ~340 examples per class. I have tried different approaches including Bi-Lstm which gives me poor results. Therefore here my architecture comprises word embeddings followed by a CNN layer with a global max pool layer followed by a dense layer. This architectures outperforms most of the architectures I have tried according to my choice of dataset.
